# Homework 7 - Neural face detection pipeline
# Updated by Edina on 10/08/2019

As the base for HW7 I used hw07-hint.ipynb notebook that came with it. 

# Describe your solution in detail. What neural network did you use? What dataset was it trained on? What accuracy does it achieve?

Answer: From my HW3 I already had a directory where image files representing camera frames were kept for verification. I modified that script to capture new frames from camera and save them down to a local directory without cutting the face. Then I created my own version of python notebook that was based on the hint, where the image being read was replaced by my fresh image. I used Tensorflow face detection model that came with the hint to detect the face, cut it out and save it to an external file (or forward on mqtt). I have used prepared model for Tensorflow face detection.

# Does it achieve reasonable accuracy in your empirical tests? Would you use this solution to develop a robust, production-grade system?
	
Answer: given time I would like to test it a bit more with variety of faces and non faces as input.

# What framerate does this method achieve on the Jetson? Where is the bottleneck?
Answer: I didnâ€™t get to extract this one.

# Which is a better quality detector: the OpenCV or yours?
Answer: OpenCV was a bit easier to use, I would need to do more testing to decide about the quality.









### Overview
The objective of this homework is simple: modify the processing pipeline that you implemented in 
[homework 3](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/blob/master/week03/hw/README.md) and replace the OpenCV-based face detector with 
a Deep Learning-based one. You could, for instance, rely on what you learned in 
[TensorRT lab 5](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/blob/master/week05/labs/lab_tensorrt.md) or 
[Digits lab 5](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/blob/master/week05/labs/lab_digits.md)

### Hints
* You have the freedom to choose the neural network that does the detection, but don't overthink it; this is a credit / no credit assignment that is not supposed to take a lot of time.
* There is no need to train the network in this assignment, just find and use a pre-trained model that is trained on a face dataset.
* Your neural detector should run on the Jetson.
* Just like the OpenCV detector, your neural detector needs to take a frame as input and return an array of rectangles for each face detected.
* Most neural object detectors operate on a frame of a given size, so you may need to resize the frame you get from your webcam to that resolution.
* Note that face detection is not the same as face recognition; you don't need to discriminate between different faces
* Here's a [sample notebook](hw07-hint.ipynb) that loads and uses [one face detector](https://github.com/yeephycho/tensorflow-face-detection)
* A more graceful solution would involve using a face detector from [TensorFlow's Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) -- [this network](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/facessd_mobilenet_v2_quantized_320x320_open_image_v4.tar.gz), to be exact, but at the moment, simply loading it as we did in [TensorRT lab 5](https://github.com/MIDS-scaling-up/v2/blob/master/week05/labs/lab_tensorrt.md)  does not work due to [this bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53563976/tensorflow-object-detection-api-valueerror-anchor-strides-must-be-a-list-wit)

### Questions
* Describe your solution in detail.  What neural network did you use? What dataset was it trained on? What accuracy does it achieve?
* Does it achieve reasonable accuracy in your empirical tests? Would you use this solution to develop a robust, production-grade system?
* What framerate does this method achieve on the Jetson? Where is the bottleneck?
* Which is a better quality detector: the OpenCV or yours?

### To turn in:

Please provide answers to questions above, a copy of the code related to the neural face detector along with access to the location (object storage?) containing the detected face images. Note that this homework is NOT graded, credit / no credit only.
